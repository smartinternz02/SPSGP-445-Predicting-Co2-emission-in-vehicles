Predicting Co2 emission in vehicles

Project Description:

The amount of CO2 emission from the transport sector (including cars) accounts for about 20% of total CO2 emissions. Accordingly, from the viewpoint of preventing global warming, reducing that proportion is a key issue. In regard to CO2 emissions from cars, fuel economy standards are getting tougher all over the world, so improving the fuel economy of cars is strongly desired. From now onwards, it is considered that the fuel economy of engines will be further improved by boosting engine efficiency and by hybridization (electrification) of cars. What’s more, improving fuel economy by improving “driving operation” (i.e. the operation in which a car is driven) and by smoothing traffic flows will come into the picture in the near future. Under these circumstances, with concern for the environment from the viewpoint of reducing CO2 and other exhaust emissions, the Hitachi Group is comprehensively promoting a broad range of technical developments for reducing CO2 emissions from cars.

Solution Requirement:


Significantly reducing CO2 emissions from cars will not be easy, but the available data can be used to extract the features, know the behavior of cars, and try to reduce the emissions. Machine Learning techniques can be used in this regard.
